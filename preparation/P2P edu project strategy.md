Work in Progress

Name: TBD (Koen)
 
What: A peer-to-peer educational project hosted on the ThreeFold Grid and using a peer-to-peer video conferencing tool, where the role of teacher and student is flipped upside down. Teachers can teach other teachers or students, and even the students are able to teach. Everybody will have to give time as part of this project, teaching time is donated. Teachers are able to get rewards through points – points can be matched to ThreeFold Tokens – and they can get rewards for doing extraordinary things during the project.

Tokens will be used to reward teachers for teaching on the platform and to students for taking action (need to look into logistics of this, can we reward students?)

Possible Ecosystem Partnerships: Artheon VR Museum, Beliive

How: Take Action Global already has a community network of thousands of teachers to launch this initiative and get this going

By When: TBD (Koen)
