mission = "DigiByte is more than a faster digital currency it is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications and secure authentication."

description = "DigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward-thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.

DigiByte (DGB) is a highly scalable peer-to-peer digital currency that enables industry-leading transaction speeds with negligible fees. DigiByte is the best way for payments.

Digi-ID is a security protocol built on DigiByte blockchain technology that empowers users to effortlessly sign-in to websites, applications, and even into the internet of things.

The three layers are the most innovative parts of the DigiByte blockchain providing the network infrastructure, security and communications to function with cutting edge speed. 
- Applications / Digital assets 
- Digital assets / Public ledger
- Core protocol / Global network

By making a noncentralized currency, asset register and identity store the world has a more efficient and less costly way of exchanging and storing value and identity.

Both foundations strive to find decentralised solutions for centralised infrastructure. The mission and values are very aligned and therefore joined projects and activities make a lot of sense.

Currently considering to use the TF Grid to be the universal substrate for running DigiByte nodes."
