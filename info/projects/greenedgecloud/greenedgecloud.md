# Green Edge

- What is the name of your project?
Answer:  Green Edge

- What is your project about? What is your mission & vision?
Answer: We are facing a tsunami of compute and storage capacity demand. The current internet giants are already struggling to meet this demand, and will continue to push their highly centralised technologies that compromise personal sovereignty and privacy, while burning through an unsustainable amount of energy and natural resources. Not only does this represent an excellent business opportunity for a truly decentralised compute & storage platform, but also an opportunity to have a positive impact on the planet and the future of the human race.  

Green Edge Cloud if farming ThreeFold grid capacity for Enterprises in world class datacenters.

- How will this benefit the earth and why do you think this is relevant? 
Answer: Green Edge Cloud believes in helping create a world where technology promotes and protects personal liberty and sovereignty. A decentralised internet is inherently faster, greener, more private, and more secure.

- What is the link between ThreeFold and your project? 
Answer: Green Edge Cloud is the first & largest ThreeFold farmer. We fully support the ThreeFold foundation, and its goals. We hope that our certified capacity will help ThreeFold acheive their mission of a green, decentralized internet that puts personal sovereignty and freedom first.


- How will your project use the ThreeFold grid and / or 3Bot?
Answer: This summer, we will start selling decentralised edge Kubernetes compute and S3 storage to Software-as-a-Service and System Integrator businesses across Europe who are looking for greener, more cost effective solutions than AWS, Azure or Google Domains.



### Roadmap

- Generic explanation: what is there today, what is coming up?
Answer: Today we have TheeFold Capacity in Frankfurt, Vienna, Salzburg, St Gallen, Toronto, Rochester, NY, and Cape Town. Soon we plan to expand into Amsterdam and Berlin.

In the Summer we will launch our Green Edge Storage S3 product, followed by Green Edge Conpute Kubernetes in the fall.

- How does your project intend to measure impact?
Answer:  Impact is measured by making Enterprise grade IT capacity available at lower commercial rates and for the future. We will monitor and report on the energy we save vs conventional Infrastructure-as-a-Service offerings.
