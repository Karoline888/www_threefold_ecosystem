For now, this peer-to-peer initiative is in the concept stage but with proper funding we can bring this vision to reality.

- How does your project intend to measure impact?
Answer: We will measure impact in multiple ways â€“ number of teachers and students brought on to the platform, number / impact of solutions brought for global projects, and more.
