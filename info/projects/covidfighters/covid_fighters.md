# Covid Fighters

## mission & vision
*Covid Fighters* want to help the people of the world to get back to somehow normal life beside keeping the highest standards of safety regarding covid virus.

People are social individuals and need contact with others. On the other hand, pandemic situations like now with corona are super dangerous especially to the weakest and older people. We need to help in both ways - re-gaining social life and staying healthy.

## Supported by threefold
Threefold could be a great partner for the identification of individuals and secure transmission of data. It is one of very few serious alternatives that are not owned by states or governments.

Both data security and storage capabilities provided by ThreeFold will be used. We will provide people with individual 3bots, so they would be identified before getting their attests.

### Roadmap
 We are running the POC these days. Actual requirements shall be defined and we’ll then roll out the covid testing containers to Austria and other countries.


## Measured impact

 Our impact can be seen in how fast people can get back to normal lives, will be allowed to work, meet their beloved ones - and still not having new peaks of COVID-diseases.
